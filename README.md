## Overview:
- Game : **Tank Turn Up**
- Game **Engine: Unreal Engine 4**
- Genre: **3D Platformer**

Tank Turn Up is a 3D platformer third person game where you play as a tank that has to traverse a terrian, collecting points whilst against a timer. Obstacles such as falling platformers, turrets that shoot back and your own momentum will hinder your progress so making sure that you have the right skills tp play the game is very important. As the Tank, you have the ability to shoot missiles, jump at high speeds and bounce off of the surrounding terrain of the level to get to the points needed to get a high score.

## Why I Created this Project
This project was part of my College FYP (Final Year Project). We were tasked in creating a 3D platformer. I deviated from what others had created and instead created a 3D platformer that you played as a tank because I found it more innovative and unique compared 3D platformers that you play as a character. I also though that Tank were not used in the 3D platformer medium so I preffered to use a tank.

The objects of the project were:
- Create a fun 3D platformer
- Relate the game to the Client Brief
- Make the game suitable for a younger audience
- The game should be based off Fall guys and similar games
- Use Unreal Engine to a high degree

The experience of creating the game was very informative and helpful as it allowed me to develop my knowledge in Unreal Engine 4 and how to use Blueprints in Unreal Engine. This was highly helpful when creating other prototypes in the future to help with my skills and knowledge development.
